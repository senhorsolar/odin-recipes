    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is the recipe for my grandma's pinto beans. Until now they're the best tasting beans I've ever had. Luckily the recipe passed down to my mom, and then to me</p>
    <p>The recipe calls for soaking beans overnight, so planning is required. It also calls for a pressure cooker. A pressure cooker isn't a requirement, but it will take ages to cook otherwise.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 medium bag of dry pinto beans (or some other variety)</li>
      <li>3 bunches of scallions</li>
      <li>2 large tomatoes</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Soak beans in water overnight</li>
      <li>The next day, start heating the beans in a pressure cooker</li>
      <li>Chop up scallions and tomatoes and saute them in olive oil</li>
      <li>Add salt to sauteed mixture</li>
      <li>Add sauteed mixture to the cooked beans</li>
      <li>Simmer on a lower temperature and let thicken</li>
      <li>Enoy the beans with <a href="./rice.html">rice</a></li>
    </ol>
