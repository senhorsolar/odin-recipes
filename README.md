# The Odin Project: Recipes

TOP Recipes project in pure html. The intent is to demonstrate basic html skills including:
* Text information such as paragraphs, headings, and lists
* Links to other pages and images

The project itself is supposed to be a website detailing several recipes in a minimalistic fashion. It contains several of my favorite foods.
